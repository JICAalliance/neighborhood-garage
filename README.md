Neighborhood Garage is a web application for a group of close neighbors/friends to share their garage/DIY tools with each other and keep tabs on who has them. With shared equipment, the neighbors as a whole save money by not having to have all the tools for their DIY projects and fixes, save time traveling to their nearby home improvement stores and save garage/storage space as well.  Having a way to keep track of who has which tool and who currently borrows one, missing tools can possibly become a thing of the past.

For future developments, this app can be incorporated into an already existing neighborhood app like Nextdoor to improve their usersâ€™ community experience or be a stand alone app and be monetized for data collection or advertisement purposes for home improvement stores.

The motivation for this project was to solve a real-world problem. Often we may rely on our neighbors for their resources and the help that they can give to us. However, if you're a neighbor that loves to loan out their tools or borrow them, it an quickly get out of hand trying to track where a tool is at any given time. This app solves that problem by tracking where tools are, who has them checked out, due dates, and more. It's the perfect app to bring together friends and neighbors and help each other accomplish tasks and economically solve problems (by not having to own every tool known to man!).

Separation of concerns and file organization turned out to be very important in the project like this where there are many different components that rely on each other for adequate function. We learned a lot about task delegation, troubleshooting, and project management through this project. It was truly fun to create!
